## Developer version
Currently the mod is in a developer version so could still contain bugs and other issues. 
We support people to use this mod and test it for us because user experience is the most important part.

At this moment the mod is on version 0.7.5.1 and has several open issues, To see all issues check [GitHub issues](https://github.com/DennisKgaming/FS22_DAF_105XF/issues)

If you decide to use the mod while it is in developer mode and you notice issues, bugs, things that are not correct, check the issues page. When it is not in the list it would be nice if you would create a new issue. When creating a new issue be as specific as possible:
* Try using the mod when you have no other mods in the map and see if the issues still exist
* Tell us the version number you are using
* Try to explain as clear as possible what you discovered
* Send us the logfile and use [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) to deliver it to us. (logfile most of the time can be found in Documents\My Games\FarmingSimulator2022 and is named log.txt )

We will try to solve the issue as soon as possible but since we are doing this in our spare time we can not give an estimate.
